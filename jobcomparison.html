                In todayâ€™s world computing is very popular and it is only getting more popular as well as it is advancing in so many different directions.
                Under the term computing fall a variety of different job constraints, activities, internships and positions in which you are able to develop the skills you need to be a part of the computing world. 
                One of the most interactive and innovative jobs on the market right now is the web developer job. 
                Every day millions of people use the internet and are visiting web sites designed by web developers on an hourly basis.  
                Web developers are builders of all those websites. Every company, hotel, agency or other societies that have a web site have had a person or rather a team of web developers to build one for them by their personal preferences.
                They do this through hours of web styling, page layout creations, page features and many more other interesting factors that make a web page unique.  
                While so much people are visiting web sites every day, around the same amount of people are using software, which are computer generated programs specifically designed to simplify day to day activities, procedures or movements of different machines, factories and companies. 
                Software engineering is a rapidly growing field that opens new job opportunities each day because of its computer language diversity and the evolvement of the environment.  
                Unlike web developers, software engineers tend to specialize in more than a few areas of development, such as databases, operating systems, networks or applications which require a vast knowledge and fluency in its own set of those computer languages. 
                Although it may seem that way, not every part of computing is just working and solving problems, surely the most fun job in the computing world is the computer games developer. 
                Video games have evolved drastically over the years and it is unimaginable what we are able to create today. 
                Game developers, with the help of software engineers have even created virtual reality, thought impossible a decade ago. 
                All of these are just a few of the variety of opportunities which the computing world provides today, they do not differ a lot from each other. 
                The salaries are roughly the same as well as working hours and conditions, in my opinion the only difference is the targeted audience, and of course, the only limitation to the job is you, how ever much you are willing to dive into the world of computing is how much you can succeed and change the world as we know it.
