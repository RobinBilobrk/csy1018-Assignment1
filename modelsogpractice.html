<p class='models_pargh'>In the beginning, as a team he could not decide on how the webpage should look like.
                        As it was mentioned in class, we were trying to go with something modern, something catchy or rather very easy on the eye.
                        Right now, it is very hard to figure out something how to get peopleâ€™s attention through webpages, so we looked through the web a little bit and stumbled upon a few pages that caught our eye. 
                        The first page that we liked was the Bear Grylls official website which has a beautiful picture of a huge mountain chain as a background for the landing page. 
                        Seeing that picture was very intriguing and made us want to look through the page a little bit. 
                        Although it was very nice, we thought it was a little bit flashy, however we liked the idea of a big picture for a background. 
                        As we looked through a little bit more, we stumbled onto another great page which is the official page of a reggae singer called Dub Fx. 
                        The page also had a picture for a background as well as had a completely different vibe from the last one since it was all dark and moody. 
                        We really liked the last page as we chose to create a webpage with similar constraints. 
                        Although the structure and the layout of page was a little bit of code wise, we were really hooked on the looks of it. </p>
