    <p class='pargh_1'>  I'm Bartosz, I'm from Poland and I've been learning programming and web dev for about 2-3 years.<br>
        My true love is JS, that's second programming language I've ever learned, but it's the one I know the most.<br>
        To polish (no pun intended, I guess now it is, but it wasn't when I created it) my skills in JS and problem solving in general, I went to <a href="http://codingame.com" target="_blank">codingame</a>.<br>
        I've been doing clash of code and some puzzles, puzzles are great for starting and learning syntax, while clash of code is great for quick problem solving and thinking of new ways to approach a problem.<br>
        Would recommend to everyone, the leaderboard keeps you motivated.<br>
        I'm also a duck master.<br>

    <p class='pargh_2'>Since I was a child computer related activities have always interested me. 
            I was very curious about how this electronic world works. During my 
            primary and middle school I attended to after school IT clubs, but 
                        majority of information I acquired those days came from the internet.
                        Right now I'm studying a games development course at the University, wishing that it will help me with getting a job in games-making industry. 
                        I enjoy playing games and presently I run a game related YouTube channel. 
                        The second thing I enjoy doing covers programming and scripting web pages.
                        Learning new functions and discovering new possibilities really satisfies me.</p>

        <p class='pargh_3'>Hi, I'm Robin, I'm an international student from Croatia. I have always been interested in computers and video games.
                Ever since I was a child I had a gaming console which I used on a daily basis which enlighted my childhood. I've spent a year in 
                the US getting a taste of their culture and exploring my future career options. After series of event I got the opportunity to study 
                the thing that I've enjoyed the most in my life, computer games development. So just like that, full of motivation I left my home once again 
                and moved to the campus of The Northhamtpon University to pursue my life long dream. I may not be the best at it, but I'll be sure to put all 
                my hearth in my career and enjoy every second of it.
