<p class='experience_title'>My Web Development experience</p>
<p class='experience_esseay'> From the start of the course I felt new to the whole system. 
                              I have never experienced such way of development and learning. 
                              I am used to the old school, teachers would just throw a bunch of stuff on the board, make us copy it or analyze it or do a such task. 
                              Rarely would a teacher highly engage in a class and actually try and make it less boring or rather interesting for a kid to be in school at that moment. 
                              Basically what I am trying to say is, I am very much amazed with the experience I’ve been having since I started the whole course, not just web development. 
                              All of the teachers are trying their best at every moment in class, everyone is so engaging, I actually enjoy coming to classes every single day. 
                              Going to school used to be a problem for me, waking up, knowing that I have something that I do not want to sit through that day but I still have it. 
                              This university is different, it is not hard to get out of bed in the morning as I get to see new people that are interested in the same type of field that I am. 
                              I get to share my experiences and my knowledge with them as well as progress in it by listening and accepting tips. 
                              Each day teachers are trying to make our mornings as well, sometimes with a little joke or a funny picture at the beginning of their presentation, whatever it is, its always cool. 
                              To summarize all of this, my first term in web development has been amazing, I’ve learned so much, however there is always room for more. 
                              I have enjoyed the company of all the people I met and enjoyed all of my classes and I hope that it will stay like that and I hope that one day I will be working in a friendly environment just like that.
